### Question 5:

Detail how the browser loads and bootstraps a rich web application from an initial URL.

### Answer:

When a user makes a request to a browser to retrieve a website, the browser does the following:

1. The browser connects to the domain name server, which acts as an address book and tells the browser where the website is located.

2. The browser connects via TCP/IP to the server's IP address and the designated port that is associated with that URL. These prototypes will show where the files that are required to load the webpage are located on the server.

3. An application server that is listening on that IP address is connected by a browser.

4. The browser sends an HTTP request via the open TCP/IP connection.

5. The application server parses the request and provides the necessary files to the browser over the same TCP/IP connection.
