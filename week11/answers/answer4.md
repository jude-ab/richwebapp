### Question 4:

With the aid of a diagram and example code, describe the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Box Model and show how it can be used to space DOM elements

### Answer:

The CSS Box Model explains how each document object model (DOM) element appears as a rectangular box on the page. It is made up of margins, borders, padding, and the content area.

CSS:

div {
width: 300px; - width of the div
border: 10px solid green; - border
padding: 40px; - space around the div contents
margin: 15px; - space around the div border
}

HTML:

<div></div>
